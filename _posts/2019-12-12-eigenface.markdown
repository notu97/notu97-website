- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to a collection of face images to generate a set of basis features.
- Projected face images onto a feature space (”face space”) optimized to encode the variation among known face images.
- Defined the face space using ’eigenfaces’, which are the eigenvectors derived from the set of faces and represent patterns of variation rather than isolated facial features like eyes, ears, or noses.
