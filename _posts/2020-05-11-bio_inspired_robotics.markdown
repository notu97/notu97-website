- Investigated the design and control of a quasi-direct-drive legged robot, gaining practical expertise in experimental robotics, mechanical design, and Python programming.
- Formulated and implemented kinematic models, deriving forward and inverse kinematics to develop Python code for precise leg position control and executing PID and time-optimal motion strategies.
- Analyzed the impact of diverse leg designs, studying variations in size, shape, series elasticity, and gearing effects to evaluate their influence on performance and efficiency.
