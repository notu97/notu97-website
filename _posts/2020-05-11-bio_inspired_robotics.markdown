Explored the design and control of a quasi-direct-drive legged robot, gaining hands-on experience in experimental robotics, mechanical design, and Python programming. Developed and implemented kinematic models, deriving forward and inverse kinematics for precise leg position control using Python, while executing PID and time-optimal motion strategies. Furthermore, I analyzed the impact of varying leg designs, including size, shape, series elasticity, and gearing, to assess their effects on performance and efficiency. This was a course project for [MAE207](https://gravishlab.ucsd.edu/teaching/) at UC San Diego.
