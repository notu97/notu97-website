Implemented an Extended Kalman Filter based Visual-Inertial SLAM algorithm to track the three dimensional position and orientation of a Car. Used data from gyroscope, accelerometer, and camera measurements. Validated the algorithm on real world [KITTI](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/) Dataset. This was a course project for [ECE276A](https://natanaso.github.io/ece276a2020/) at UC San Diego, hence the code cannot me made public.
