Implemented and compared the performance of A* and Rapidly expanding Random Tree (RRT*) Algorithm in terms of planning time and path length on multiple 3D environments with obstacles in Python. This was a course project for [ECE276B](https://natanaso.github.io/ece276b2020/) at UC San Diego, hence the code cannot me made public.
