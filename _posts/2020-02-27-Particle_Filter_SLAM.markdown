Evaluated the Particle filter using real-world odometry data, indoor 2D laser scans, and RGBD measurements captured by THOR, a humanoid robot equipped with LiDAR and Kinect v2 sensors. The Particle filter successfully demonstrates its effectivity in capturing highly non-linear motion and measurement models. I used Sample Importance Sampling for resampling the particles inorder to address the particle depletion phenomenon. This was a course project for [ECE276A](https://natanaso.github.io/ece276a2020/) at UC San Diego, hence the code cannot me made public.
